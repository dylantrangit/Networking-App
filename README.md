A university capstone project that explores the design and implementation of a
mobile networking platform connecting mentors and mentees through a swipe-based
matching experience.

The app focuses on providing an initial point of contact between mentors and
mentees, with one-on-one, in-person mentoring sessions coordinated through the
platform. It was designed with accessibility and approachability in mind,
particularly for first-generation and shy students. 

Documentation can be found in the pdf's provided.
